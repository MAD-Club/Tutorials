		//Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variables
		//Arrays are useful so you can keep your code more organized and have
		//unnessary variables removed.

		//Normally you could declare your variables like this
		var BR = "<br />";
       		var darren = "Darren";
		var cai = "Cai";

		//With arrays you can combine both of these as they have simillar purposes
		var teachers = ["Darren", "Cai", "Peter", "Nicholas"];
        

		//The way you declare an item in an array is to call the variable name with 
		//the corresponding number of the item in square brackets, for example

		document.write(teachers[1] + " gives out alot of homework" + BR);
		document.write(teachers[0] + " plays kahoot in class" + BR);
       
        // This will loop through all the entries in the array. 
        //It uses teachers.length to find the length of the array.

            // Outputs the teachers name
