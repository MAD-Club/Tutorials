# Linux / Unix Basic commands

Basic commands to get you around terminal.

## Navigating Through Terminal

- `cd` -> Moves to a specified directory. For example, doing `cd` would take you to the root directory of your computer. You will need to specify a directory. Some examples:
  - If I'm at `~/Desktop` and I want to navigate to a folder called `Projects`, then I can do: `cd Projects`.
  - If I'm at `~/Desktop/Projects` and I want to navigate back to Desktop. `cd ~/Desktop`, OR: `cd ..`. (The 2 dots, `..`. First `.` means your current directory. So 2 dots, means to go back. There's no 3 dots however).
- `pwd` -> Prints out your current directory.
- `ls` -> Lists your file contents in your current directory.
