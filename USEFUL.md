# Useful Tools/Links for Devs

Not really a tutorial, but these are some useful tools/links that may help you when designing your UI, or creating those beautiful materialistic designs. (Website or Mobile)

## Server Hosting / Dev Tools

* GitHub Student Pack - Amazing tools as a developer (https://education.github.com)
* Heroku - Cloud Host. I think it should be free for students, not 100%, but the ability to use git push deployments is great. (https://www.heroku.com/)
* JSFiddle - JavaScript Fiddling around. (https://jsfiddle.net/)

## IDE's or Source Editors

* Sublime Text 2/3 - Text Editor. Super verstaile, probably my favourite editor of all time. (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* Atom - Github's Text Editor. The other good alternative
* Visual Studio Code - Microsoft's Open Source Code Editor. Uses Packages like Sublime, to get some amazing tools.
